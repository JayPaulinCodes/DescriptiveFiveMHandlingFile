      <!-- handlingName 
      Used by the vehicles.meta, to identify the handling line of the particular vehicle.
        - Any text no more than 14 characters can be used. The Vanilla vehicles use uppercase letters by default. Example: ADDER, DINGHY 
      -->
      <handlingName>HandlingNameHere</handlingName>

      <!-- fMass 
      The weight of the vehicle. 
        - Values should be given in Kilograms.
        - Used when the vehicle collides with another vehicle or a non-static object. 
      -->
      <fMass value="4522.000000" /> 

      <!-- fInitialDragCoeff
      Sets the drag coefficient of the vehicle. Increase to simulate aerodynamic drag.
        - Value: 10-120 
      -->
      <fInitialDragCoeff value="5.500000" />

      <!-- fPercentSubmerged
      The percentage of the vehicle's "floating height" after it falls into the water, before sinking.
        - Default - 85% for vanilla, land vehicles. The value will stop sinking the vehicle to float for a moment before sinking. Boats excluded.
        - Value: Any percentage. Should be given in decimal. Example: 0.70 (70%)
        - An invalid number will cause the vehicle to sink without the driver drowning.
      -->
      <fPercentSubmerged value="85.000000" />
      
      <!-- vecCentreOfMassOffset
      Shifts the center of gravity in meters from side to side.
      Values:
        - (0 means that the center of gravity will be in the center of the vehicle.)
        - X: -10.0 to 10.0. Positive values move the center of gravity right.
        - Y: -10.0 to 10.0. Positive values move the center of gravity forwards.
        - Z: -10.0 to 10.0. Positive values move the center of gravity upwards
      -->
      <vecCentreOfMassOffset x="0.000000" y="0.000000" z="0.000000" />
      
      <!-- vecInertiaMultiplier
      This value affects the ease with which the vehicle spins around each axis. 
      Therefore, the x axis affects how quickly the car shifts forward and back under braking and acceleration 
      and how it rotates end over end in the air, 
      the y axis affects how quickly the car shifts from side to side when cornering (or in the air) 
      and the z axis affects how the car rotates around the middle, 
      which mostly manifests as appearing to turn into corners very quickly. 
      Recommend keeping the z value around 2.0 and above because anything less looks very unnatural.
      *** Note: Four cars do not respond typically to this value; the police3 (Police Interceptor), 
      Gang Burrito, 190Z and Zion Classic. 
      They need lower z values or else they will rotate around corners like they are stuck in mud.
        - X: -10.0 to 10.0.
        - Y: -10.0 to 10.0.
        - Z: -10.0 to 10.0.

      -->
      <fDriveBiasFront value="0.000000" />
      
      <!-- nInitialDriveGears
      Obviously, this line determines how many forward speeds/gears a vehicle's transmission contains.
      *** It is not recommended to have a value higher than 8 here as issues with downshifting can occur if the car's top gear is higher than 9th gear.
      Values:
        - 1-16 or more. 
      -->
      <nInitialDriveGears value="6" />
      
      <!-- fInitialDriveForce
      This modifies the game's calculation of drive force (from the output of the transmission).
      Values: 0.01 - 2.0 and above.

        - Values less than 1.0 will in effect give the vehicle less drive force.

      -->
      <fInitialDriveForce value="0.377000" />
      
      <!-- fDriveInertia

      <!-- fInitialDriveMaxFlatVel
      This determines the vehicle speed at redline in the top gear (not the show).
      ** Setting this value DOES NOT guarantee the vehicle will reach the given speed. **
      Values: 0.00 and above.
        - Multiply the number in the file by 0-82 to get the speed in mph.
        - Multiply by 1.32 to get the speed in kph.
      -->
      <fInitialDriveMaxFlatVel value="140.250000" />
      
      <!-- fBrakeForce
      Obvious one. Multiplies the game's calculation of deceleration.
      Values: 0.01 - 2.0 and above.
        - Bigger numbers = harder braking.
        - 1.0 uses brake force calculation unmodified.
      -->
      <fBrakeForce value="0.900000" />
      
      <!-- fBrakeBiasFront
      This line controls the distribution of braking force between the front and rear axles.
      Values: (Similar to fDriveBiasFront)
        - 0.0 means the rear axle only receives brake force.
        - 1.0 means the front axle only receives brake force.
        - 0.5 gives both axles equal brake force.
        - Values between 0.01 and 0.49 means the rear axle will receive more brake force.
        - Values between 0.51 and 0.99 means the front axles will receive more brake force than the rear.
      -->
      <fBrakeBiasFront value="0.425000" />
      
      <!-- fHandBrakeForce
      Another obvious one. Braking power of the handbrake.
      Values:

        - 0.0 or above.
      -->
      <fHandBrakeForce value="0.600000" />
      
      <!-- fSteeringLock
      This multiplies the game's calculation of the angle of the steer wheel will turn while at full turn. Steering lock is directly related to over/under-steer.
      Values: 
        - 0.01 and above.
        - Values between 0.1 - 0.2 will simulate a long wheelbase.
        - Values around 0.75 and above will turn extremely fast. Higher values will cause the vehicle to spin out easily.
      -->
      <fSteeringLock value="40.000000" />

      <!-- fLowSpeedTractionLossMult
      How much traction is reduced at low speed.
        - 0.0 means normal traction. It affects mainly car burnout when pressing gas (W/UP).
        - Decreasing value will cause less burnout, less sliding at start.
        - Higher value will cause more burnout.
      -->
      <fLowSpeedTractionLossMult value="1.000000" />
      
      <!-- fCamberStiffnesss
      This value modify the grip of the car when you're drifting.
